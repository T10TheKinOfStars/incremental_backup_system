This project is about increase storage upload files like dropbox
It is implemented by using C++ and thrift
Used to study rsync algorithm and implement a simple file system to synchronize files

checksum.hpp/cpp        compute rolling-checksum and md5 checksum
md5.h/cpp               generate md5 string
package.hpp/cpp         generate send information and process rececive information
file.hpp/cpp            file operations
search.hpp/cpp          search rolling checksum
mytypes.h               define typedef things
SmartSync_client.cpp    client
SmertSync_server.cpp    server
smartSync.thrift        thrift file
client1/client2         test folder
files                   folder to store server files

The first version has completed on May 3 2015

You can run server as ./server
You can run client as ./client ip port --dir xxxxxx

Once you run the server, the server will listen the requesets from clients.
Once you run the client, it will automatically check all the files in directory and compare
them with files on server. If they are different, they will be synchronized to the latest
version. The lateset version is based on the file modify time.

The synchronization algorithm is based on rsync, which will use rolling checksum and md5 checksum
to tell which part should be sent as content and which part should be only sent identification.

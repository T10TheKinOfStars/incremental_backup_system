This project is about increase storage upload text files
It is implemented by using C++ and Apache Thrift software framework
Used rsync algorithm to implement the increamental storage system

thrift file:
smartSync.thrift        define data structure and service

function files:
checksum.hpp/cpp        compute rolling-checksum and md5 checksum
common.h                define macro funtions for debugging and funs to compute struct size
md5.h/cpp               generate md5 string
package.hpp/cpp         generate send information and process rececive information
file.hpp/cpp            file operations
search.hpp/cpp          search rolling checksum
mytypes.h               define typedef things
SmartSync_client.cpp    client
SmertSync_server.cpp    server
smartSync.thrift        thrift file
client1/client2         test folder
files                   folder to store server files

auto generate files:
smartSync_constants.h/cpp
SmartSync.h/cpp
smartSync_types.h/cpp

How to use:
1 make
2 ./initclient.sh
3 run server as ./server 1024                             (1024 is blocksize, which can be set to other value. It should be the same for server and client)
4 go to clients' directory and run client as ./client ip port 1024 --dir directoryname (1024 is blocksize, which can be set to other value. It should be the same for server and client)

Once you run the server, the server will listen the requesets from clients.
Once you run a client, it will automatically check all the files in directory that you given and compare them with files on server. If they are different, they will be synchronized to the latest version. The lateset version is based on the file modify time. When one file on server is accessed by one client, other clients cannot access to the same file on server even check whether it is the lateset version.

The synchronization algorithm is based on rsync, which will use rolling checksum and md5 checksum to tell which part should be sent as content and which part should be only sent identification.
